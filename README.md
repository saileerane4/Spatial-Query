# Spatial-Query
Computing Convex Hull and finding three nearest neighbors using spatial queries

### Part 1: 
computed the convex hull for 9 points plotted in and around USC campus. Uploaded the results on google earth to verfiy the correcteness of the implemented query. Refer file query.txt

### Part 2:
computed the three nearest neighbors for a fixed location entered by the user. Used the distance function to find the nearest neighbors for a given location. Top 3 were filtered out for our results

### Part 3: 
creating a Spirograph around a given location. Plotted the points generated by the java program which loops over the area to find the x and y co-ordinate in the spiral path. These co-ordinates were plotted on Google earth to check the validity of the program.
